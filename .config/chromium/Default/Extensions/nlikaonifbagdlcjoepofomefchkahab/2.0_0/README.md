# Bandcamp Volume

A Chrome Extension to add a volume slider to most [bandcamp](http://www.bandcamp.com) pages.

## Usage
You can test this out by cloning the repository and simply loading it into chrome as an unpackaged extention.

## Background
I browse Bandcamp a lot for albums which uses an html5 based audio player. This player, however, lacks any form of volume control. When asked about it, Bandcamp responded with the following:

From the [Bandcamp FAQ Page](http://bandcamp.com/faq#volume):
> There isn't one. If your fans want to change the volume of the audio on Bandcamp, they adjust their computer's volume -- simple as that. We're not trying to build the ultimate platform for them to stream your albums while they play World of Warcraft in another window (which we completely agree would require an independent volume control). The streams on Bandcamp are there so visitors can listen to your music, decide if they like it, and if so, download it. Nothing more.
