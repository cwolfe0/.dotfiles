                StravistiX extension is just adding some features that riders and runners would like to see in their Strava web. If these features could be added by default in Strava... It could be cool! Consider getting Strava Premium. There are a ton of features that
                you will love. Remember, this extension has for ambition to enhance the experience of all users (Free and Premium) and tends to keep users loyal in Strava.
